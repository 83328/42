# 42 School Projects

Welcome to my 42 School project repository! This collection represents my journey through the curriculum of 42, a revolutionary coding school.

## What is 42 School?

42 is a unique, tuition-free coding school that operates on a peer-to-peer learning model. Founded in Paris by Xavier Niel, the school has since expanded globally with campuses worldwide. What makes 42 special:

- **No teachers, no courses** - Students learn through projects and peer collaboration
- **Gamified curriculum** - Progress through levels by completing increasingly complex projects
- **Self-paced learning** - Each student advances at their own rhythm
- **Project-based approach** - Learn by doing real-world programming challenges
- **Peer evaluation** - Students review and grade each other's work
- **24/7 access** - The school is open around the clock for maximum flexibility

The curriculum covers fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, system administration, web development, and advanced topics like graphics programming and machine learning.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my projects from the 42 curriculum, organized by core levels:

- **00_basics/** - Introduction to C programming and basic concepts
- **core_02/** - Advanced algorithms and data structures (push_swap, so_long)
- **core_03/** - System programming and Unix concepts (minishell, philosophers)
- **core_04/** - Object-oriented programming with C++ and graphics (cub3d)
- **core_05/** - Advanced C++ concepts and exception handling
- **exams/** - Solutions to various exam exercises

## Learning Journey Disclaimer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code represents my learning journey at 42 School. As such, it may not always reflect production-quality code or best practices. The projects here are educational in nature and were completed as part of my progression through the curriculum.

**Please note:**
- Some solutions might be suboptimal or contain beginner mistakes
- Code style and practices evolved throughout my learning process
- Early projects may lack sophistication compared to later ones
- This is a documentation of growth, not a showcase of perfection
