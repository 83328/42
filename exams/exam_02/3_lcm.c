Write a function who takes two unsigned int as parameters and returns the
computed LCM of those parameters.

LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of two non-zero integers is the smallest postive
integer divisible by the both integers.

A LCM can be calculated in two ways:

- You can calculate every multiples of each integers until you have a common
multiple other than 0

- You can use the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of these two integers and
calculate as follows:

	LCM(x, y) = | x * y | / HCF(x, y)

  | x * y | means "Absolute value of the product of x by y"

If at least one integer is null, LCM is equal to 0.

Your function must be prototyped as follows:

  unsigned int    lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b); */

unsigned int lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)
{
	unsigned int n;

	if (a == 0 || b == 0)
		return (0);
	if (a > b)
		n = a;
	else
		n = b;
	while (1)
	{
		if (n % a == 0 && n % b == 0)
			return (n);
		++n;
	}
}

int main() 
{
    unsigned int num1, num2;

    printf("Enter two positive integers: ");
    scanf("%u %u", &num1, &num2);

    unsigned int result = lcm(num1, num2);

    printf("The least common multiple of %u and %u is %u\n", num1, num2, result);

    return 0;
}
